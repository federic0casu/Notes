          Block Ciphers          
==================================

Block ciphers, as the name suggests, encrypt block of bits (while stream ciphers encrypt one bit at 
time). What is the mathematical (rigorous) definition of a block cipher? 

Definition 1. [Block cipher] A  block cipher is a keyed permutation; in other words, the cipher itself
defines a bijective permutation that maps each element of the plaintext space to exactly one element of
the ciphertext space, as a function of the key.

The algorithm implemented by a block cipher is nothing more than a deterministic algorithm; it's the 
key that introduces randomness into the encryption process. Let me explain better:

    a. Consider the plaintext and ciphertext space; both are composed of integers belonging to 
       [0, 2^n - 1].
    b. A block cipher implements a one-to-one mapping between the plaintext space and the ciphertext 
       space: each plaintext is linked exactly to an element of the ciphertext space. The mapping is
       chosen by the key; each key defines one possible mapping.

It can be proven that a block cipher can be a perfect cipher, but only under certain circumstances.


==================================
	True Random Ciphers          
==================================

Let Perm be the set whose elements are all the possible permutations of {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^n. Since 
Card[{0,1}^n] = 2^n, Card[Perm] = (2^n)!

A True Random Cipher is a block cipher with the following properties:

	1. Implements all the possible permutations in Perm.
	2. Randomly select a permutation as a function of the key.
	
Fact 1. A true random cipher is perfect for Shannon.

Discussing stream ciphers, we've seen that it is possible, albeit impractical, to implement a perfect 
cipher. Unfortunately, in practice, a perfect block cipher cannot be implemented. To implement all the 
possible permutations in Perm, a block cipher should have keys whose size (in bits) is

	sizeof(key) = log_{2}[(2^n)!] ~ (n - 1.44)(2^n)
	
The number of bits required to index all the possible permutations in Perm grows exponentially with 
the block size. This means, in practice, a perfect block cipher cannot be implemented because:

	1. If the block size is too small (with the goal of making practical keys), an attacker could 
	   mount a brute-force attack by enumerating all the possible permutations.
	2. To discourage a brute force attack, we should use block that at least are 64 bits long. With 
	   those numbers, we have keys that are roughly 64(2^{64}) bits-long!
	   
What is the best we can hope for?
